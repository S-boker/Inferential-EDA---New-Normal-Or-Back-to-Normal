# Inferential-EDA New Normal Or Back to Normal

## The problems:
  1. Were their any differnces between Houston and NYC hospitals in their Timely & Effective Hospital Care metrics in 2017-18
  2. After the pandemic, have we reached have our Timely & Effective Hospital Care metrics have reveted back to the 2017-18 metrics or have our meterics entered a new normal

## Solution
By perfroming various t-tests using the public avaible data from the CMS, centers for medicare and medicaid services, on Timely & Effective Hospital Care metrics in 2017-18 we can see if there are any significant statistical differences. For the first problem we take various Timely & Effective Hospital Care metrics Houston and NYC hospitals in 2017-18, and the second problem we will use Timely & Effective Hospital Care metrics from all hospitals in 2017-18 with the national averages for this year's Timely & Effective Hospital Care metrics and the Texas and New York state averages for this year's Timely & Effective Hospital Care metric. With that data we can perfrom the t-tests necessary to answer our questions. 

## Findings:
### Problem 1
  - In terms of effective care NYC Hospital's EDs and Houston Hospital's EDS are similar as far as we can tell
  - However, Houston is more effective in admiting patients and giving them care in timily matter
  - The latter inference could be due to NYC Hospital's EDs having higher ED volumn than Houston

### Problem 2
  - Are our hospitals back to pre-covid performance in timely & effective hospital care according to the metrics given by Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS)?
    * Not Really
  - What about specific urban cities?
    * They have in NYC and Houston
  - What about specific Emergency Department (ED) metrics and regular metrics?
    * Emergency Department metrics have fallen behind while our regular metrics have improved

## What is next
   - Letâ€™s look at what the heavily urban cities like NYC and Houston are doing in their EDs.
   - Why have urban cities like NYC and Houston not improved from pre-covid?
